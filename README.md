Biomechanics is the science focusing on the mechanics of body movement. The orthopaedic health condition of a person can be detected from his/her biomechanical features. The dataset provided in this project contains six biomechanical features (namely, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius, grade of spondylolisthesis) and diagnosis for 310 patients. The biomechanics attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine. The patient diagnosis falls into three different categories:

A) Hernia is when there is an injury to the cushioning and connective tissue between vertebrae  

B) Spondylolisthesis is a medical condition in which one of the vertebrae slips out of place onto the bone below

C) Normal: No injury

The goal of this project is to predict patient diagnosis based on biomechanical features. Machine learning algorithms in medical fields have widely been used in disease prediction as such approaches may be considered of great assistance in the decision making process of medical practitioners.
